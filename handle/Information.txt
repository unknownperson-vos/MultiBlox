#==== What Is "handle64.exe"? ====# 

MultiBlox includes a file named handle64.exe, which is an official tool created by Microsoft Sysinternals.  
It is not malware, not modified, and never obfuscated.

Handle is a legitimate command‑line utility used to:

- View open handles in Windows processes  
- Close handles inside a process  
- Inspect file, registry, and event handles  

MultiBlox uses "handle64.exe" only for one purpose:

-> To close the ROBLOX_singletonEvent handle, which prevents Roblox from blocking multiple instances.

This is the same technique used by many legitimate developers and system administrators.


#==== Is "handle64.exe" Safe? ====#

Yes, it is 100% legitimate and made by Microsoft.

#==== Want to Replace "handle64.exe" With Your Own Copy? ====#

If you still prefer not to use the bundled file, you can manually download your own copy from Microsoft and replace it.

Here’s how:

Step 1 -> Download Handle from Microsoft Sysinternals

1. Open the official Microsoft page:  
   https://learn.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/handle
2. Click "Download Handle"
3. Extract the .zip file somewhere on your PC

Inside the extracted folder you will find:

- handle.exe (32‑bit)
- handle64.exe (64‑bit)


Step 2 -> Use the Correct Version

Roblox runs as a 64‑bit process, so MultiBlox MUST use:

-> handle64.exe

❌ Do NOT use "handle.exe" (the 32‑bit version)  
It will not work and cannot access Roblox process handles.


Step 3 -> Replace the File in MultiBlox

1. Go to your MultiBlox folder  
2. Delete the old handle64.exe 
3. Take your downloaded handle64.exe from Microsoft  
4. Copy it into the MultiBlox folder (same place as Start.bat / MultiBlox)
5. Done, MultiBlox will automatically use your version


#==== How to Verify the File Yourself (Optional) ====#

If you want full transparency, you can:

- Upload your version of "handle64.exe" to VirusTotal  
- Compare the hash with Microsoft’s official version  
- Open the .zip from Sysinternals and verify the signatures

Microsoft Sysinternals executables are digitally signed by:
-> Right-click → Properties → Digital Signatures → View Certificate to confirm.


#==== Summary ====#

- "handle64.exe" is an official Microsoft Sysinternals tool
- MultiBlox uses it ONLY to close a Roblox handle safely
- It is NOT modified or obfuscated
- It may trigger false positives because it’s a system tool
