**MultiBlox** is an advanced, beginner-friendly **Roblox multi-instance manager** written in Python with a full graphical interface.  
It allows you to run **multiple Roblox accounts at the same time** by automatically handling Roblox’s singleton restrictions, monitoring processes in real-time, and giving you deep insight into each running instance.

**Requires no setup, run MultiBlox, then simply join with as many roblox accounts as you want via browsers or bootstrappers. That's it.**

MultiBlox is designed to work not only with the **default Roblox launcher** and on **browsers**, but also with **custom bootstrappers**.

Roblox normally prevents you from opening more than one client at a time using internal **mutexes and events**.  
MultiBlox automatically detects newly launched Roblox processes, **closes the required handles**, and lets you open **as many Roblox instances as your system can handle**.

On top of that, MultiBlox provides:
- Real-time process detection
- Roblox account identification (username, user ID, avatar)
- Per-instance process analytics
- Custom automation (scripts on open/close)
- Extensive logging & debugging tools
- A clean, modern GUI

All of this runs **locally**, without injecting code into Roblox.

## 🔒 About `handle64.exe` (Safe & Official)

MultiBlox uses **handle64.exe**, a tool from the **Microsoft Sysinternals Suite**, to safely interact with Roblox process handles.

- **Official Microsoft page:**  
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle)

- **Purpose:**  
`handle64.exe` lists and manages open system handles.

- **Why MultiBlox uses it:**  
Roblox locks certain handles to prevent multiple sessions. MultiBlox uses handle64.exe to detect and release these locks, allowing unlimited sessions.

**Important:** `handle64.exe` is **safe, legitimate, and maintained by Microsoft**.
